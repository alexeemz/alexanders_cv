          <ul>
              <li>In my final Year at Bandon Grammar School I was awarded the title
              of school <strong>prefect</strong>, allowing me to excercise my leadership qualities.
              In this role I had the responsibility of setting and maintaining the highest standards 
              of <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>attitude</strong>, <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>motivation to work</strong> within the student body.</li><br>
              <li>I have honed my <strong>ability to collaborate</strong> with others on projects over many years. In Transition year
              I led a team of three to the finals of the <strong>BT Young Scientist and Technologist Exhibition</strong> in Dublin. Throughout my 
              first year in University I have been engaged in several group projects in which my teammates and I had to <strong>compromise</strong>, <strong>communicate</strong>
               and <strong>delegate</strong> to achieve top grades.</li><br>
               <li>I am  adept at <strong>communicating as a team</strong> in a busy, <strong>high pressure environment</strong>. These skills have been strenghtened in my part-time position at The Glandore Inn,
               a busy restaurant in the tourist hotspot of Glandore, West Cork.</li>
