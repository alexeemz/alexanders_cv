          <ul>
              <li>In my final Year at Bandon Grammar School I was awarded the title
              of school <strong>prefect</strong>, allowing me to excersise my leadership qualities.
              In this role I had the responsibility of setting and maintaining the highest standards
              within the student body with regards to <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>attitude</strong>, <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>motivation to work</strong>.</li><br>
              <li>I have honed my <strong>ability to collaborate</strong> with others on projects over many years. In Transition year
              I led a team of three to the finals of the <strong>BT Young Scientist and Technologist Exhibition</strong> in Dublin and throughout my 
              first year in University I have been engaged in several group projects in which my teammates and I had to <strong>compromise</strong>, <strong>collaborate</strong>
               and <strong>delegate</strong> to achieve top grades.</li><br>
               <li>I am  adept at <strong>communicating as a team</strong> in a busy, <strong>high pressure environment</strong>. These skills have been strenghtened in my part-time position at The Glandore Inn,
               A busy restaurant in the tourist hotspot of Glandore, West Cork.</li>

                    my <strong>ECDL</strong> in secondary school and working with such programs on a day-to-day basis as part of my
                    University course.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>I possess a core understanding in the programming languages of 
                    <strong>Visual Basic</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
                    My profficiency in such languages is constantly developing and I am eager to further expand my skillset.</li><br>
                    <li>I can work efficiently with <strong>spreadsheets</strong> and I have an introductory level of proficiency in
                    <strong>Database development</strong> achieved through working with <strong>Microsoft Access</strong>.</li>
