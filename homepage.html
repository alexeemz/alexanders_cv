          <ul>
              <li>In my final year at Bandon Grammar School I was awarded the title
              of school <strong>prefect</strong>, allowing me to exercise my leadership qualities.
              In this role, I had the responsibility of setting and maintaining the highest standards 
              of <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>attitude</strong>, <strong>respect</strong> and <strong>motivation to work</strong> within the student body.</li><br>
              <li>I have been elected as<strong> Vice-Captain of the UCC JiuJitsu team.</strong> In this position I am responsible for <strong>communicating on behalf of the club with both the coach and the UCC Clubs Committee.</strong>
              It is also my responsibility to ensure inclusion amongst all members and <strong>fulfill a leadership role in training sessions and external club activities and events.</strong></li><br>
              <li>Throughout my University career I have been engaged in several group projects in which my teammates and I had to <strong>compromise</strong>, <strong>communicate</strong>
               and <strong>delegate</strong> to achieve top grades.</li><br>
               <li>I am  adept at <strong>communicating as a team member</strong> in a <strong>high pressure environment</strong>. These skills have been strengthened in my part-time position at The Glandore Inn,
               a bar and restaurant in Glandore, West Cork.</li>

                    My proficiency in such languages is constantly developing and I am eager to further expand my skillset.</li><br>
                    <li>I can work efficiently with <strong>spreadsheets</strong> and I have experience in
